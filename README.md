# Yum
### Overview:
Yum is a minimalist responsive web application built with the **MERN stack** that allows users to donate excess food and reduce food waste. Did you know that roughly one-third of the food produced in the world for human consumption every year (approximately 1.3 billion tonnes) gets lost or wasted? That is perfectly good food that is thrown away due to imperfections in shape and colour. Yum aims to change this by allowing both individuals and establishments to contribute to solving the food waste problem by donating their excess food.

Users can create postings using the interactive UI built with **React** and **Bootstrap**. To allow users to save listings, a backend server built with **Node** and **Express** allows user's to create accounts and login. Using **JWT**, user authentication is done and passwords are encrypted in the **MongoDB** which stores users and listings. To facilitate meetings between user's a chat function was implemented using ****** . Using the interactive map built with ****** users can see which listings are in their area.

### Features:
* Register a new account and login using the minimalist and responsive UI which contains a checking system to make sure only one email is used per account
